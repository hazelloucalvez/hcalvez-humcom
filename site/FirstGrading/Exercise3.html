            <p><i>Easy-peasy salmon recipes!
            </br>
            Fish can be daunting to cook as the last thing you want to do is to overcook it but fret not! We’ve gathered a bunch of salmon recipes that you can do right at the comfort of your home and honestly, cooking is pretty therapeutic even if you’re just starting out.
            </br>
            We chose salmon because during these trying times (or any time, actually) we should be eating healthy and salmon is a whole bunch of healthy… among many things, salmon has omega-3’s, selenium, vitamins A and D that helps to boost your immunity, reduce the risk of heart disease, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis essentially, making your bones stronger! Salmon also keeps you full longer because it offers lean protein… imagine a 4 oz salmon, that can easily give you 26g of protein! By being full longer, it’ll curb your unnecessary cravings.
